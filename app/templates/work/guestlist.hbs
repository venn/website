      Event holders start with the core Guestlist application which enables them to create and manage their events. We expanded functionality and refined the experience based on user feedback and support requests over several major itterations.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the early decisions we made that has proven to be very flexible is to use a what-you -see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWIG) editor to create the public website for events. It sets Guestlist apart from other applications in its category and has been a big large factor in making the application seem very simple at first glance.

      People rely on Guestlist to processes millions of dollars in fees so reliability was a big concern from the start. Guestlist is built on Rails and Posgres with automatic backups happening on a continous basis.

      Keeping with the idea of being flexible, we wanted people to be able to build their own websited for their events if they so choose. To enable this we build a fully embeddable checkout system. It can be added to any website to allow the user to buy tickets. The user does not have to leave the website when they make a purcahse, and it works on all devices.
