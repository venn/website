    With three distinct applications spanning web, mobile, and a marketing website, Guestlist is a massive and ongoing project.

      Event hosts start with the core Guestlist application which enables them to create and manage their events. We expanded functionality and refined the experience based on user feedback and support requests over several major iterations.
    </p>
    <p>
      An early decision that has proven very successful is the use of a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWIG) editor for creating public event websites. It sets Guestlist apart from other applications in its category and has been a large factor in making the application seem very simple at first glance.

      People rely on Guestlist to processes millions of dollars in ticket sales so reliability was a big concern from the start. Guestlist is built on Rails, Ember, PostgreSQL, and Redis with automatic backups happening on a continous basis.

      While public event pages can be customized extensively, many hosts require full control over their site presentation. To facilitate this, the Guestlist checkout application is fully embeddable into any website. Customers do not have to leave their hosts' website when they make a purchase, and it works on all devices.

      To improve the experience of managing event check-ins, we designed and built a tablet application that event hosts can use at the door.

      The check-in application also supports barcode scanning to help attendees spend less time waiting in line.
